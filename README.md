# To-Do-List
A to-do list is a productivity tool that helps users organize and prioritize their tasks. In your implementation, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you likely have the following main features:

* Task Addition: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering text into an input field and clicking an "Add" button. This interaction uses JavaScript to capture the input and display it on the list.

* Task Deletion: Each task likely has a delete option that removes it from the list, helping users keep only relevant tasks.

* Marking Tasks as Complete: Many to-do lists allow users to mark tasks as complete, often by clicking a checkbox. Completed tasks might have a visual change, such as strikethrough text or a lighter color.

* Styling and Layout: CSS is used to style the list for readability and user experience. This includes the layout, colors, and fonts that make the to-do list visually appealing and easy to interact with.
